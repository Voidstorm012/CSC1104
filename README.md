# Student Data Management and Waveform Analysis

## Description
This project consists of two main components:
1. **Student Data Management**: A program written in C to manage and process student data.
2. **Waveform Analysis**: A dataset containing waveform data for analysis.

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash

    ```

## Usage
### Student Data Management
1. Run the `NewStudent` program:
    ```bash
    ./NewStudent
    ```

### Waveform Analysis
The `waveformData.csv` file contains data for waveform analysis. You can open this file using any spreadsheet software or use it in data analysis programs.

## Features
- **Student Data Management**: 
  - Adding new student data
  - Processing existing student data
